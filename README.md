# Covid19detection
AI project to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images
Detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning
Like most people in the world right now, Iâ€™m genuinely concerned about COVID-19. I find myself constantly analyzing my personal health and wondering if/when I will contract it.
I care about you and I care about this community. I want to do what I can to help.
Note: This Demo doesn't say that X-ray images are the best approach for identifying if a person is infected with COVID-19. It's just a demonstration of showing how Python+AI can walk and talk together to achieve some real results in the crisis and in general

To run this project you need to run train_covid19.
To test this project you can just run Covid_GUI and choose the xray image it tells you whether the person infected with carona virus or not.
